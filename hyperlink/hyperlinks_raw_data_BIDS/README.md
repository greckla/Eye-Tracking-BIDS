Detailed information about the paradigm you can find in the corresponding publication:
Gagl, B. (2016). Blue hypertext is a good design decision: no perceptual disadvantage in reading and successful highlighting of relevant information. PeerJ, 4, e2467.

## Task Design
320 sentences with an invisible boundary within the sentence were presented.
To investigate the preview benefit under specific conditions, the sentence part behind the boundary was masked and manipulated. The condition varied by font color (blue vs. black) and underlining (underlined vs. not underlined). As the preview benefit was focused specifically, one half of the sentences was masked by degradating the letters until the boundary was passed. The event messages included in the dataset represent the moment when the boundary was passed with a saccade. When the mask was degradated, in the moment the boundary was passed, the degadation of the letters disappeared. The event ended and the sentence disappeared when the next boundary on the right side of the screen was passed.

The participants were asked to fixate the fixation cross and then read the sentences naturally as they would read a book or a newspaper. After they have read the sentence they should look to a fixation cross in the right down corner of the screen. With this action they automatically passed the boundary and the sentence disappeared.

After some sentences a question sign appeared and the experimenter asked the participant a question about the content of the sentence to check if the participant understand it. The correctness of the answer was recorded by the experimenter by pressing the key "r" ("right") or "f" ("false").

## Eye-tracking
AOI
The AOI is the single 5-letter word after the invisible boundary.
