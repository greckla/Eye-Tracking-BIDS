# PSC Pre-Post Diagnostic

## Task Design
The task consisted of 36 sentences from the Potsdamer Sentence Corpus (Kliegel et al., 2004). The sentences appeared after the calibration check on the fixation cross and disappeared as soon as a saccade crossed the invisible boundary on the right sight of the screen.

The participants were asked to fixate the fixation cross and then read the sentences naturally as they would read a book or a newspaper. After they have read the sentence they should look to a fixation cross in the right down corner of the screen. With this action they automatically passed the boundary and the sentence disappeared.

After some sentences a question sign appeared and the experimenter asked the participant a question about the content of the sentence to check if the participant understand it. The correctness of the answer was recorded by the experimenter by pressing the key "r" ("right") or "f" ("false").

Each participant absolved four versions of this task, conducted each before and after a three-day-long reading intervention as a diagnostic procedure. Between the second and third session, there were 2-5 weeks delay. The order of the task versions was randomized across participants. Before each session there were ... practice trials to get familiar with the paradigm. Data from practice trials do not include any messages and cannot be analysed.

## Stimuli
The 144 sentences from the PSC Database were devided into four sets used in four task versions.

The text was presented in a monospaced font (black on white background; Courier-New font; 0.3° of visual angle (resp. 11 px) per letter)  


## Eye-tracking
Movements of both eyes were tracked with a sampling rate of 1,000 Hz (Eyelink 1000, tower mount system; SR-Research, Ontario, Canada). We used a forehead and chin rest to position the head of the participant at a distance of ca. 60 cm from a LCD screen of 38.6 x 29 cm size (19???) with a resolution of 1024 x 768 pixels and a refresh rate of 150 Hz on which the task was presented. The task was programmed with the software Experiment Builder (SR-Research, Ontario, Canada; Version 2.2.61).
