# Emotional Faces Dataset

## Task Design
The procedure resembled that described by Lazarov and colleagues (2018). During the main task, participants were presented with 64 stimulus matrices in 2 blocks of 32 matrices each. 
Every trial started with a fixation cross presented for 1 second after a fixation was detected. Then a 4x4 stimulus matrix of face photographs was presented for 6 seconds. After the matrix a blank screen was shown for 2 seconds.

Before the main task, participants were presented with 3 practice trials of task 1 to become familiar with the task. For the practice trials, we used different models from the FACES database than for the main task (see stimulus material).

All participants viewed task 1 (main focus for the replication of Lazarov et al., 2018) before task 2 (task variation for exploratory purposes). 

Participants were told that there was no particular task. They were asked to look at the photos as it naturally occurred to them. 

## Stimuli
We presented 4x4 stimulus matrices of 16 colour photographs of human faces displaying emotional expressions. The photos were taken from the photo database FACES (Ebner et al., 2010): 
Task 1 (happy + sad): 8 faces with happy and 8 faces with sad expression
Task 2 (happy/sad + neutral): 8 faces with happy or sad and 8 faces with neutral expression

The stimuli were randomly assigned to the 16 positions of the matrix with the following restrictions:
- 8 faces each for the 2 emotional expressions represented in the matrix
- 8 male and 8 female faces (counterbalanced for the emotional expressions)
- every of the 16 selected models appeared once in each matrix
Of the 4 faces at the centre of the matrix
- 2 were male, 2 were female
- 2 faces each for the 2 emotional expressions represented in the matrix

In task 1 (happy + sad) each of the selected photos was shown exactly once on every matrix position in one block (32 trials / block). In task 2 (happy/sad + neutral), the counterbalancing of photos on matrix positions was implemented across the two blocks. Each block contained 50% happy + neutral and 50% sad + neutral trials.

Not more than 3 trials with expressions of the same type (happy + neutral or sad + neutral, respectively) were presented subsequently. 

Each photo stimulus was presented with a size of 200 x 200 pixels (approx. 5.55 x 5.55 cm, visual angle ~ 5.28°), leaving a distance of 20 pixels (approx. 0.6 cm) between stimuli. Overall, each stimulus matrix measured 860 x 860 pixels (approx. 24 x 24 cm).

## Eye-Tracking
Movements of both eyes were tracked with a sampling rate of 1,000 Hz (Eyelink 1000, tower mount system; SR-Research, Ontario, Canada). We used a forehead and chin rest to position the head of the participant at a distance of 60 cm from a LCD screen of 47.2 x 29.5 cm size with a resolution of 1680 x 1050 pixels, on which the task was presented. The task was programmed with the software Experiment Builder (SR-Research, Ontario, Canada; Version 2.2.61). 

For the practice trials, we use a 9-point standard calibration. Before each block of the main task, we conducted a 13-point standard calibration. A calibration was considered as accurate when the mean error was <= 0.6° of visual angle for both eyes. Before each trial, the calibration was checked during the presentation of a fixation cross. During the task, whenever no fixation was detected within 5,000 ms in a region of 48 x 48 px at the centre of the screen (fixation cross 15 x 15 px at the centre of the screen), this automatically led to recalibration. After recalibration, the task continued with the next trial. When a fixation was detected, the fixation cross was presented for another 1,000 ms and then followed by the presentation of a stimulus matrix.

Data from practice trials do not include any messages and cannot be analysed.
